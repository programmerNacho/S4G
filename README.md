This a prototype of a VR serious game developed while I was working at ViralStudios.

We play as a surgeon arriving at his/her new workplace, in which we will have to solve the problems that
our team faces.
Its objective is to develop the soft skills needed for a team leader, to quickly, and assertively, fix
his/her team communication problems.
